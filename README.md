# Programming Languages Reference

A reference for languages in terms of syntax and language nuances. I created this repository so I could store
the practice that I have with various languages, such as jade, regex, handlebars, java, c++, so that if I need
to solve a problem, often times a quick look at my previous syntax can help me remember the language as a whole.
I hope that over time, this will contain valuable information that others can use as well.

***

### Jade (100%)

> Jade is an html preprocessor that allows you to write more concise code that compiles into html. It allows
> for the use of mixins, as well as variables, all through inclusion of javascript-like scripts.

### Regular Expressions (100%)

> Regular expressions are an invaluable language because they allow certain operations to take seconds. It makes
> use of expressions surrounded by "/" in order to filter out certain data from the strings and can be used in
> conjunction with search functions.

### Structured-Query Language (100%)

> SQL is one of the more dominant database languages nowadays so it's invaluable to know this information. A lot
> of this code was helpful with Stanford's CS 145 (Introduction to Databases) class. For more in-depth use cases,
> check out the repository on my code from my courseloads.
